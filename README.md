# Social Artifacts / Quantified Bird

Social Artifacts is a look at experiences that are shared through digital mediums can have their meaning or context of the "now"  minipulated, misinterperated, or even lost. 

We all share our experiences on Social Media but we often overlook how the experences we share become altered with the loss of context and all of the sensory information you were exposed to. Your followers understaning is often a simplier understanding of what you experienced because they did not have access to the same sensory information you did.

### Documentation
Social Artifacts reads the analog audio output from the Digibird and interperits the original audio than minipulates it to varying degrees which is controlled using a Poteniometer. The minipulated audio is than broadcasted to a secondary speaker. This reinterperated audio uses the same frequency as the original Digibird output but is simplified to only digital frequencies which overpowers the original higher quality audio.

### Schematic

The Arduino prototype board is a replacement for the Digibird
